GITFLOW: 

- Always work on your local branches (like solo-bvirk1357)
  - Create branch using command: git co -b solo-<your username>
  
- Steps to push your code up into github
  1) Commit your changes in the local branch 
  2) Switch to master branch on your local dir (git co master)
  3) git pull
  4) Switch to your branch
  5) Merge in lastest changes from master by doing on your branch:
     - git merge master
  6) After resolving any conflicts do a final commit into your own repo.
  7) git push origin <branch>
  8) On github, create a pull request

Done!
