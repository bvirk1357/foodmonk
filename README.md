GITFLOW: 

- Always work on your local branches (like solo-bvirk1357)
  - Create branch using command: git co -b solo-<your username>
  
- Steps to push your code up into github
  - Commit your changes in the local branch 
  - Switch to master branch on your local dir (git co master)
  - git pull
  - Switch to your branch
  - Merge in lastest changes from master by doing on your branch:
     - git merge master
  - After resolving any conflicts do a final commit into your own repo.
  - git push origin <branch>
  - On github, create a pull request

Done!
